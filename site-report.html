        <h2 class="sitereport-subtitle">MAJOR Design Choices In Development</h2>

        <p class="paragraph-centered">
            In terms of the overall layout and syntax of the website, it is a 
            fairly basic three-layer design with a Header, Main Section and a Footer 
            to which all align under a CSS Grid. All content on every page is within 
            the Main Section and may use either a Nested Grid or Flexbox depending on 
            the viewport (mobile or desktop). This approach is quite simple and allowed 
            for a consistent layout across all pages. Creating the nav/header was
            a ball-ache trying to figure out the best way to show and display it as well as 
            show and hide the hamburger icon.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-centered">
            In regard to the stylistic choices, I found it quite challenging to match colours 
            together to create a seamless design. I decided to go with a Black & Taupe approach 
            styled with White Accents & Text, sometimes Grey. Furthermore, trying to make everything 
            responsive was both easy and hard. When it came to text and centering and re-sizing, 
            things got very messy, but I pulled through in the end.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sitereport-subtitle">Index / Home Page</h2>

        <p class="paragraph-centered">
            For the main landing page, I’ve decided to keep it extremely minimalistic in terms of what is displayed. 
            I decided to use a profile / avatar image of myself (since the main focus of the site is to show, essentially, 
            who I am and what I do) and under that, give a brief introduction. 
            <br><br>
            This is the first page I started with. It developed an overall base for the rest of the website.
        </p>



        <h2 class="sitereport-subtitle">Portfolio Page</h2>

        <p class="paragraph-centered">
            The portfolio page proved to be extremely difficult to create for the most tedious reasons.
            As I wanted images as the main item in each row, with text displaying while hovering over it, 
            I had to make some sacrificial design decisions. Getting the text to display CENTERED and OVER 
            the image was troublesome. This was because the text naturally will appear below or on the right 
            of the image as that is how HTML generally works. However, to make it appear centered - WHILE RESPONSIVE TO MOBILE DESIGN – 
            I HAD to use ABSOLUTE and RELATIVE POSITIONING. This is not really allowed in the assignment, however, 
            it DOES state that you are not allowed to use absolute positioning “for anything that is ALWAYS on the page”. Key Word here being 'always'. 
            Luckily, the text used is NOT ‘always’ visible on the page, so – technically – I am safe to use it in this specific circumstance. 
            Believe me, I scoured the web for about an hour trying to find a solution to which absolute positioning was not used, 
            and I couldn’t find one. Since the text is relative to the image, it makes sense to use it here. Another option was to use a div, and set
            the background to the div as an image. This is not best practice as I have to create a css selector for each image. Using absolute positioning 
            is technically more efficient here.

        </p>

        

        <h2 class="sitereport-subtitle">Blog Page</h2>

        <p class="paragraph-centered">
            For the blog, it was a similar approach to how I did the portfolio design in terms of the grids and columns and items within each row, however, 
            the item itself is largely different. To make it blog-esque, I made sure text was always visible below an image along with having a header and 
            basic text below to give an overview of each blog element. Trying to make this responsive with mobile was quite hard.
        </p>

        


        <h2 class="sitereport-subtitle">Contact Page</h2>

        <p class="paragraph-centered">
            The contact page varies from many of the other pages. For this, I enclosed the contact form within a container box for the desktop version of the website. 
            For the mobile version, I put everything in to one column with a green background to show separation of content. I also decided to use a different font 
            for the form by downloading it dynamically from <a class="no-styling" target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com/">fonts.google.com</a>. 
        </p>



        <h2 class="sitereport-subtitle">Site Report Page</h2>

        <p class="paragraph-centered">
            In regard to this current page, I am currently writing this as I work on it. Generally, this page uses mostly a free, 
            flexible and spur-of-the-moment-styling choice with 4 columns in a grid, containing a range of images relevant to the 
            development process of the website.

        <h2 class="sitereport-subtitle">Overall Module Experience</h2>

        <p class="paragraph-centered">
            Coming from a past of mainly focusing on Back-End Development and paying Front-End Designers to create the HTML & CSS, 
            this module, so far, has proven to be extremely difficult as I am not very creative, nor am I good at front-end design. 
            However, I have learnt the absolute basics of HTML and CSS and I am extremely more confident now to how elements align 
            and know a good set of memorable properties. 
            <br><br>
            The problem I have with front-end development is that you either know or don’t know certain tags and selectors and techniques. 
            You are basically forced to google for solutions and it does not involve as much logical thinking than Back-End Web Development. 
            I found it extremely problematic and frustrating trying to fix a page and make everything responsive. Not being able to use templates 
            and bootstrap, for example, made things extremely hard. It was necessary though, as I wouldn’t have learnt the basics. 
            <br><br>
            Chris Rafferty, the module leader, has been extremely helpful, and has taught each topic of this module so far really well! 
            I can really learn from Chris – A solid teacher! 
            <br><br>
            Overall, the module so far has been quite fun as well as challenging, and I can’t wait to get in to Year 2 
            where Back-End Web Development comes in to play because that is what I have experience in. Javascript later on in this module 
            will be great to learn too!
